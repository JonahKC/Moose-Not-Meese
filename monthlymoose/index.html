					<img id="photo" src="./np-moose.jpg" width="50%" height="250px" align:"left">
					<p class="nptext">Shortly after founding Moose Not Meese, Jonah, a huge fan of moose, founded the Monthly Moose (originally called the Moose Gazette) to be the definitive source for all moose news globally. Based in Seattle, it was the leading publication discussing moose-related news around the world. It ran for about a year and a half, from mid-2019 to the beginning of 2021. It brought moose news to it's subscriber's inboxes on the 1st of every month. It's articles ranged from moose history to moose in pop culture to current moosey events. During the COVID-19 pandemic, they reached out to the CDC to ask what the risk of moose getting the novel coronavirus is. They then followed up with well-researched updates. At it's peak, Jonah employed two additional writers: Hannah and Olen. They wrote many articles over the course of the Monthly Moose. The Monthly Moose may come back at some point, so feel free to sign below.</p>
